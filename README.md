# Word Scramble Master

A revolutionary word game that combines the best of Boggle and Balatro, creating an addictive roguelike word-finding experience for iOS.

## Game Concept

**Word Scramble Master** reimagines the classic Boggle word-finding gameplay through the lens of Balatro's innovative roguelike progression system. Instead of poker hands, you form words from a letter grid to defeat increasingly challenging word puzzles, purchasing powerful upgrades between rounds to enhance your vocabulary prowess.

### 2. Word Formation
